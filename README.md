# scroll_gallery
Scroll through large number of pictures in a folder.

TODOS - 

1. Add scroll instead of buttons
2. Add multiple pictures in single window
3. Use filesystem to get imglimit instead of hardcoding it 
4. Show speed affects in comparison with loading 500 pictures at once

Limitations - 
All pics should have a welldefined naming scheme with indexes, example pic12.jpg
