# Scroll Gallery
Scroll through large number of pictures in a folder.
Improved speed of picture loading against the older way of adding all images in HTML at once.

TODOS - 

1. Implement Basic one by one picture viewing.
    - (Done!) (Loading times are very slow)
2. Add scroll instead of buttons 
    - (Having problem) (Do later)
3. Decrease image loading times
    - (Reduced with the help of data window of len 10)
    - (window length changeable)
4. Add multiple pictures in single window
5. Use filesystem to get imglimit instead of hardcoding it 
6. Show speed affects in comparison with loading 500 pictures at once

Limitations - 
All pics should have a welldefined naming scheme with indexes, example pic12.jpg
